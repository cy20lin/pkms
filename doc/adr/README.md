# PKMS – Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This document records key architectural decisions made during the early design of PKMS (Personal Knowledge Management System).
The goal is to **preserve design intent**, clarify trade-offs, and provide future contributors (or future-you) with the *why*, not just the *what*.

## Closing Notes

These ADRs intentionally favor:

* Long-term evolvability
* Clear semantic boundaries
* Local-first reliability

They are **not immutable**. Each ADR may be revised with a new record when constraints change.
