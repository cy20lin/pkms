```text
Design a minimalist icon representing an anchor stabilizing information.

Visual concept:
- A simple anchor symbol positioned above or partially embedded into
- A stack of abstract information layers (e.g. flat rectangles, slabs, or sheets)
- The anchor visually connects to or presses down on the information stack

Style:
- Flat, geometric, minimal
- No text, no letters, no numbers
- Clear silhouette
- Symmetrical or visually balanced

Information layers:
- Abstract (not realistic paper)
- No visible text or icons on them
- Represent accumulated knowledge, not documents UI

Anchor:
- Simplified, iconic shape
- Not nautical-detailed
- More symbolic than literal

Color & contrast:
- Monochrome or two-tone
- Must work inverted (light/dark mode)
- No gradients, no shadows

Scale:
- Must remain legible as a favicon (16x16, 32x32, 64x64)
